Write a Java program that:

Takes the filename as a command-line argument.

Reads integers (1 to 50 inclusive) from the file using Scanner.

Stores the valid numbers in an Container.

Implements the following functions:

getMean: Calculates and returns the mean.

getMode : Calculates and returns the mode using a simple frequency array (without HashMap).

getMedian : Calculates and returns the median by sorting the list.

If the file is empty or contains no valid numbers, it should display an appropriate message.

The program should print the Mean, Mode, and Median of the numbers in the file.
